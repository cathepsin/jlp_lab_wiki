# Determining the Secondary Structure of a Conceptualized Sequence
## Purpose
This workflow describes the process for synthesizing, cleaving, and purifying a conceptualized protein sequence, as well as how to determine its secondary structure.

## Workflow
test


1. Synthesize a peptide
	- [[Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis - RT]]
		- **Time:** ~30 min per amino acid
	- [[Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis - OP Microwave]]
		- **Time:** ~5 min per amino acid
	- *Progress can be verified at any point by performing a [[Micro-Cleavage|micro-cleavage]]*
2. Cleave the peptide from resin
	- [[jlplab/01_LabProcedures/Cleavage|Cleavage]]
		- **Time:** ~5 hours
3. Lyophilize your peptide
	- [[Lyophilization]]
		- **Time:** ~10 hours
4. Purify peptide
5. Prepare protein samples for circular dichroism
6. Perform circular dichroism
