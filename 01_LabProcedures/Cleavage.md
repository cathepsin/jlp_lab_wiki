# Cleavage
## Summary
Procedure for cleaving synthesized peptide from acid-labile resin ()
Full TFA cleavage after completion of coupling amino acids and acetylation.  Can be done with many different scales (including microcleavage).

**Cleavage uses [[Trifluoroacetic Acid]], a dangerous strong organic acid.** When handling [[Trifluoroacetic Acid]], wear elbow-length neoprene gloves and a face shield along with other standard PPE.
## Materials
- Dram Vial
- Syringes & needles
- Vortex
- Nutator mixer
- 50ml centrifuge tubes
## Reagents
- [[DCM]]
- [[Cleaving Solution Preparation|Cleaving Solution]]
- Resin-loaded peptide
- [[Acetonitrile]]
## Procedure

### Cleavage
1. Swell peptide resin in [[DCM]] for 10 minutes. Then drain.
2. Carefully draw out [[Cleaving Solution Preparation|cleaving solution]] into your peptide-containing syringe and push out the air. Once all the air is removed, cap your syringe.
	- This can be done by holding the syringe upside-down and pushing the air out. Do this with caution as cleaning solution contains [[Trifluoroacetic Acid]]
3. Pull back plunger to create negative pressure within the syringe
	- For typical small-scale synthesis, 1ml of empty space is appropriate
4. Add 45ml of [[Diethyl Ether]] to a centrifuge tube. Prepare a tube **for every 2 - 4ml of peptide solution**. Set the centrifuge tubes in the freezer during the duration of the next step so that they are cold for step 6
5. Mix syringe on Nutator mixer for **4 hours**
6. Split peptide solution between each of the prepared tubes. Again, each tube should receive 2 - 4ml of peptide solution
7. In a second dram vial, add 1ml-2ml of [[Trifluoroacetic Acid]], and draw into your peptide syringe. Then split between the prepared centrifuge tubes
	- This step is not strictly necessary, but will help cleave residual peptide to increase your overall yield
8. Centrifuge your centrifuge tubes on max speed with balance for 5-7 minutes or until gummy-white peptide has clearly separated
9. Carefully discard the liquid portion of the centrifuge tubes
10. To each centrifuge tube, add 5ml of Milli-Q water and 5ml of [[Acetonitrile]]. Vortex each tube and then combine into a single tube.
11. Place tube in freezer to store or continue to [[Lyophilization]]
