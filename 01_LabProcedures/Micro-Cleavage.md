# Micro-Cleavage
## Summary
A method for cleaving a small amount of peptide from your resin. Resulting peptide can be analyzed further using mass spectrometry, IR spectrometry, NMR, etc.

**Cleavage uses [[Trifluoroacetic Acid]], a dangerous strong organic acid.** When handling [[Trifluoroacetic Acid]], wear elbow-length neoprene gloves and a face shield along with other standard PPE.
## Materials
- Microcentrifuge tube
- Nutator mixer
## Reagents
- [[DCM]]
- [[Cleaving Solution Preparation#Reagent Amounts|Cleaving Solution for micro scale]]
	- [[Triisopropylsilane|TIPS]]
	- [[Trifluoroacetic Acid|TFA]]
	- Milli-Q Water
- Resin-loaded peptide
## Procedure
1. Swell peptide resin in [[DCM]] for 10 minutes. Then drain.
2. Add 100µL of [[Cleaving Solution Preparation#Reagent Amounts|Cleaving Solution for micro scale]] into a new microcentrifuge tube
3. Using a plastic spatula, scoop a small amount of peptide-loaded resin from your syringe into the microcentrifuge tube
4. Mix microcentrifuge tube on Nutator mixer for 35 minutes
5. After mixing, evaporate all liquid using gentle compressed lab air in a fume hood
6. After fully evaporated, add 100ml of Mill-Q water and centrifuge so that all resin is at the bottom of the tube
7. Add about 90µL of the peptide-water solution to a new tube. **Do not** add resin beads. These can damage analytical instruments
