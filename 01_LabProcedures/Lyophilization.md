# Lyophilization
## Summary
A technique for removing volatile substances from a sample through freeze-drying at extremely low temperatures and pressures
## Materials
- Lyophilizer
## Reagents
- [[Workspaces/Sammy/Cleavage|Cleaved Peptide in water/acetonitrile solution]]
- [[Acetone]]
- Dry ice
## Procedure
1. Shock-freeze your capped centrifuge tube containing [[jlplab/01_LabProcedures/Cleavage|cleaved Peptide in water/acetonitrile solution]] in an [[Acetone]] bath containing dry ice
2. Once completely frozen, poke several holes into the cap of the centrifuge tube
3. Lyophilize according to machine specifications until volatile mass is removed. This often (but not always) results in a white mass that crumbles easily
4. Store lyophilized peptide in a freezer for later use
