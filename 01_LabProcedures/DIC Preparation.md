# DIC Preparation
## Summary
Preparation of DIC solution used especially for [[Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis - OP Microwave]]. This prepared solution is usually good for 24 hours
## Materials
- An appropriately sized vessel for scale
## Reagents
- [[DIC]]*
- [[NMP]]*
\* *See notes section for reagent amounts*

## Procedure
1. Combine [[DIC]] and [[NMP]] in a labeled vessel
2. Vortex mixture until totally homogenous
