# [Peptide Acetylation]
## Summary

This procedure caps the N-terminus with an acetyl group. This prevents the N-terminus from adopting a charge and can increase its stability from certain forms of degradation. 

## Materials
- Syringe tube used during [[Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis - RT|room temperature]] or [[Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis - OP Microwave|elevated temperature]] peptide synthesis (or another source) **with** peptide resin
## Reagents
- [[DCM]]*
- [[Triethylamine|TEA]]*
- [[Acetic Anhydride]]*
- \* *See notes for reagent amounts*

## Procedure
1. Add [[DCM]], [[Triethylamine|TEA]], and [[Acetic Anhydride]] to peptide syringe tube in quantities indicated below.
2. Stir solution on plate for 30 minutes with no heat and low speeds.

## Notes

### Reagent measurements
In general, your reagents [[DCM]], [[Triethylamine|TEA]], and [[Acetic Anhydride]] should come in roughly a 20:1:5 ratio
### Wash well beforehand
Before performing this technique, ensure that you have washed your peptide well with [[DCM]]. Residual [[DMF]] from synthesis steps can hinder or compete with the acetylation reaction.
