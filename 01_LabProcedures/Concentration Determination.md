# Concentration Determination

## Summary
Procedure for determining the concentration of dissolved peptide in an aqueous solution. This procedure in principle can be adapted for any software, but is written specifically for [OlisWorks software](https://olisclarity.com/ and machinery).
## Materials
- UV-Vis cuvette
- Tube of Water
- Tube of Acetone
- Vacuum and flask for eliminating water and acetone 
## Reagents
- Peptide solution analyte
- [[GdmCl]], 8M
- 0.5 M Phosphate Buffer
- Water (MQ)
## Procedure
1. Make in triplicate from the table below each solution in the plastic microcentrifuge tubes
2. Make 3 blanks (refer to the table below but instead of peptide, use 5 uL more of water)
3. gather materials and head across the hall
4. On the compute click on the program OlisWorks
5. Click "yes" that it can make changes
6. Click Run Bootp
7. Click Launch Bootp
8. Click on the white button on the machine to turn it on 
9. Wait for the light to go from yellow to green
10. Once green, press initialize
11. Program will then pull up
	1. Click the box that enables text output
	2. Make sure the wavelengths are set to 280 and 400
12. Hit collect REF (without the cuvette inserted)
13. Start by pipetting 100 uL of blank into the cuvette
14. Place the cuvette in the slot and press start data collect
15. Label the data (blank_1 or sample_1)
16. Repeat for each sample
17. Turn off the machine by closing out of the program and pressing the white button again
18. Data can be saved by pressing save and naming it (doing it this way will allow for it to be a text file which is easier to copy and paste in excel)
19. Open gmail and send the data to the jlpricelab gmail account
20. Open the Peptide concentrations excel document and copy the data over 
	1. ensure the extinction coefficient is correct by making sure the number of tryptophans and tryosines is correct

## Notes

For amount of each reagent to use, please refer to the table below:

| Reagents                    | Volume |
| --------------------------- | ------ |
| Total Volume (uL)           | 100.0  |
| Peptide Stock (uL)          | 5.0    |
| 8 M GdnHCl (uL)             | 74.8   |
| 0.5 M Phosphate Buffer (uL) | 4.0    |
| Water (MQ) (uL)             | 16.2   |
