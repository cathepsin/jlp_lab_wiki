# Checklist
- [ ] Read paper 1 on phage display
- [ ] Read paper 2 on phage display
- [x] Search for bug causing beta sheet dataset to fail training
- [ ] Update training logfile and generator logfile to dump the entire .json in the header. May be messy, but this way we *always* guarantee that all settings are saved

# Notes
Bug still isn't quite found, but set up some important diagnostics. Running on old more-stable version on Google colab.

Took much more effort than hoped and needed to plan TA stuff for tomorrow. Will read papers tomorrow
