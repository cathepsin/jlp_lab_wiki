Did a whole bunch of things today and the last little while -- Very bad at logging things in here

Previously, I created 10 MPNN sequences and will create 10 ProtBERT sequences to compare how they do. This was done using the DW3036 backbone.

Over the weekend we synthesized MPNN1, 2, and 4. Today we cleaved and are currently lyophilizing them. Will see where they come out

Found that Mary Lou now has a .ipynb interpreter. Tomorrow will figure out the script
