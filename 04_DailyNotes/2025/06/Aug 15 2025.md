# Notes
Created some more sequences using this command/checkpoint from the 250 epoch run. Seems quite stable

python3 Generator.py BG.json -m ../abProtBERT_SI_old/model_directory/ -c T_BETA/checkpoint_70000.pth -v -p

Looks like training is stable up to 96000 steps. Between that and 97000 it destabilizes and starts only predicting [PAD]

Outline for introduction coming together. Goal to finish intro by EOTD Monday
