# Notes

Today I spent most of my day working on Aldepyde. I rewrote the cache_manager so that it could be much more versatile. I want to rewrite my uniref reader that I made a couple days ago in Aldepyde so that it can gain some usage.

I have some papers from Dr. Michaelis to read based on yesterday's discussion. I will try to do this over the weekend
