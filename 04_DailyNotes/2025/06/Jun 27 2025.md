- [x] Solubility tools. Look into the following:
	- [x] ProteinSOL
	- [x] TISIGNER
	- [x] SoluProt
- [ ] Small change experiment. What happens if you make only a small change from an output sequence rather than an input

# Notes

[ProteinSOL (2018)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/19/3098/3857748?login=true)
- Linear scaling algorithm. Not ML/DL
- Quick and easy, but not *super* well tested. Paper only reports testing one model sequence

[SoluProt (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/1/23/6070085?login=true)
- Deep learning model with a web server
- Specifically predicts solubility in *E. Coli*
- At least at publication, SOTA model for *E. Coli* solubility. Tested against 11 other methods
- Results in 49.7% better guessing than blind

[TISIGNER SoDoPE (2020)](https://tisigner.com/sodope/faq)
- This link is to an FAQ. There is also a paper attached that can be found on the page
- Fares well against other models, but no discussion on how it *actually* does in any type of tiered or ranked way

**After looking at these three different options, I feel like SoluProt is what I should use, though each is easy enough to use. It appears most methods are specific to E. Coli systems, however, which may result in limited usefulness across the board**
