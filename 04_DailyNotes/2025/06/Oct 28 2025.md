# Notes
The tSNE and UMAP graphs are a bit harder than anticipated, but should be worth it, as that's essentially the best way to probe what is going on inside of ProtBERT. Hopefully tomorrow we can get the sequencer done.

As a note, there are two ways to do this, I may do both and then determine which is better later;

- \[CLS] token embedding: Tokenize a sequence and pass through ProtBERT. Extract the in-context embedding for the \[CLS] token from each processed sequence and see how it plots
- Global average pooling: Need to look a bit more into what exactly this is, but I believe it is an average representation of every token in a sequence (minus the \[CLS], \[SEP], and any \[PAD] tokens), based on their final hidden state
Both seem to have merit, but I need to get that solid
