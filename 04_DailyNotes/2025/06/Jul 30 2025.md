# Notes

Created a program to satisfy one of Josh's ideas that we may run with more. Basically, imagine a situation where we could engineer an enzyme to create specific amino acid linkages (i.e. an enzyme for ligating T + N --> TN). If we were to do this, how many enzymes would we need?

I programmed a script that totals all neighboring pairs of amino acids across all peptides in the UniRef90 and then created a script that would take that histogram and partition peptides according to what pairs either already exist in a bank of useful enzymes per their frequency in the original histogram. This is a variation of the travelling salesman problem, so I may need to try some things to get a better solution. So far it seems that there are about 5 clear winners (AA, LA, GL, AV, LS, LV), but there may be different candidates depending on different parameters I set. I will talk with Josh and see what he wants to do
